# Indonesia-Japan-Voice-Translator  


## Overview  
This is a personal side project related to my NLP research. It aims to convert Indonesian language text into Japanese language text. I want to clarify that this project is not intended for commercial use. It is solely for my own learning and experimentation. If you decide to use my code, I kindly request that you refrain from using it for commercial purposes and attribute the creator appropriately.
